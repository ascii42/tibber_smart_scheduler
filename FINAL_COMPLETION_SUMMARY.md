   - Preserves manual overrides
   - Clear automation status

6. **✅ Graphical Price Charts**
   - SVG charts showing price vs schedule windows
   - Base64-encoded data URLs for dashboard use
   - Visual representation of optimal periods
   - Current time indicators and grid lines

### 📁 File Organization

7. **✅ Clean Codebase**
   - Moved 39 maintenance files to `archive/` directory
   - Clean, organized structure
   - Only essential files in main directory

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Switch Entity Structure
Each device now has **3 switch entities**:

```
switch.tibber_scheduler_[device]     # Main scheduler (with charts)
switch.[device]_power                # Direct device control
switch.[device]_automatic_mode       # Automation toggle
```

### Stable Timing System
- **1-hour cache** for schedule calculations (fixes instability)
- **Live countdown timers** (minutes_until_start/stop)
- **Hour-boundary alignment** for consistent windows
- **schedule_locked** attribute shows stability status

### Chart Visualization
- **SVG generation** with price lines and schedule bars
- **Base64 encoding** for dashboard integration
- **Interactive elements** with current time indicators
- **Responsive design** with proper scaling

### Performance Optimizations
- **Dual caching system**: 1-hour (schedule) + 15-min (attributes)
- **Smart updates**: Only timers update, schedule stays stable
- **Efficient parsing**: Optimized price data processing
- **Graceful degradation**: Works even with missing sensors

## 📊 Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ next_start changed every minute (user confusion)
- ❌ Missing next_stop functionality
- ❌ No manual device control
- ❌ No visual price representation
- ❌ Cluttered codebase with 39+ maintenance files

### After Fix:
- ✅ **Stable schedule**: next_start locks for 1 hour
- ✅ **Complete timing**: next_stop with dates and countdowns
- ✅ **Full control**: 3 switches per device for all scenarios
- ✅ **Visual charts**: Price graphs with schedule overlays
- ✅ **Clean codebase**: Organized, maintainable structure

## 🚀 Ready for Production

### Files Updated/Created:
- `switch.py` - **Completely rewritten** with 3 switch classes
- `UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `verify_upgrade.py` - Automated verification
- `test_chart_demo.py` - Chart demonstration
- `demo_chart.html` - Interactive chart preview
- `archive/` - 39 organized maintenance files

### Verification Status:
```
🎉 UPGRADE SUCCESSFUL!
✅ All core files present and functional
✅ All enhanced functionality verified
✅ Archive organization complete
✅ Documentation comprehensive
```

## 🔄 Next Steps for User

1. **Restart Home Assistant**
2. **Check for 3 new switch entities per device**
3. **Verify stable next_start timing** (should NOT change every minute)
4. **Test price chart visualization** in dashboard
5. **Open `demo_chart.html`** to see chart example

## 📈 Impact Summary

This upgrade transforms the Tibber Smart Scheduler from a basic scheduler with timing issues into a **comprehensive, stable, visual smart energy management system** with:

- **Stable scheduling** (fixes the primary user complaint)
- **Complete device control** (manual + automatic modes)
- **Visual price intelligence** (charts showing optimal periods)
- **Professional codebase** (clean, maintainable, documented)

**User Experience**: From confusing, unstable timing → Clear, stable, visual energy management

**Developer Experience**: From cluttered, hard-to-maintain → Clean, organized, well-documented
